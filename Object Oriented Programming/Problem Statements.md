1. Create a class named weather report that holds a daily weather report with data members day_of_month, hightemp, lowtemp,a mount_rain and amount_snow. Use different types of constructors to initialize the objects. Also include a function that prompts the user and sets values for each field so that you can override the default values.
Write a menu driven program in C++ with options to enter data and generate monthly report that displays average of each attribute.
2. A Book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as title, author, publisher, price and available stock.
Write a program in C++ which will have a class called books with suitable member functions for
i. Add
ii. Update
iii. Search a book
iv. Purchase a book (update the stock and display the total cost)
v. Record number of successful/unsuccessful transactions (use static data
members to keep count of transactions)
Use new operator in constructors to allocate memory space required.
3. Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and
parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two complex numbers using operator overloading.
i. Addition and subtraction using friend functions
ii. Multiplication and division using member functions
4. Design a base class with name, date of birth, blood group and another base class consisting of the data members such as height and weight. Design one more base class consisting of the insurance policy number and contact address. The derived class contains the data members’ telephone numbers and driving license number.
Write a menu driven program to carry out the following things:
i. Build a master table ii. Display iii. Insert a new entry iv. Delete entry v. Edit vi. Search for a record
5. Create a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data and compute_area() for calculating area of figure. Derive two classes’ triangle and rectangle. Make compute_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements.
Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area.
6. Write a program in C++ which includes the code for following operations :
i. A function to read two double type numbers from keyboard
ii. A function to calculate the division of these two numbers
iii. A try block to detect and throw an exception if the condition “divide-by-zero”
occurs
iv. Appropriate catch block to handle the exceptions thrown
7. Write a program in C++ using function/class template to read two matrices of different data types such as integers and floating point values and perform simple arithmetic operations on these matrices separately and display it.
8. Write a program in C++ to implement sequential file for students' database and perform following operations on it
i) Create Database ii) Display Database iii) Add a record
iv) Delete a record v) Modify a record
9. Create employee bio-data using following classes i) Personal record ii))Professional record iii) Academic record Assume appropriate data members and member function to accept required data & print bio-data. Create bio-data using multiple inheritance using C++
10. Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes few records into it, closes the file and open it again as an input file and read the information from the file
